pubspec.yaml 中的版本号+构建号
> The following defines the version and build number for your application. A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43 followed by an optional build number separated by a +. Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively. Read more about versioning at semver.org.

version: 1.0.0+1
